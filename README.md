# üñ© **Assembly Language Calculator**

## **üìñ About the Project**
This project is an **educational assembly language calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations:  
‚ûï Addition  
‚ûñ Subtraction  
‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication  
‚ûó Division (with division-by-zero error handling)  

The program runs in a loop, continuously asking the user for input until they enter `-666` to exit.  
At the end of execution, it displays the **total number of operations performed** during the session.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**
This program is strictly for **educational purposes only**.  
‚ùå **It should not be used in real-world financial or production systems.**  
‚ùå **It does not handle advanced floating-point arithmetic.**  
‚úÖ **The purpose of this code is to demonstrate assembly programming concepts like loops, conditionals, function calls, and user input handling.**

## **üõ† Features**
‚úÖ **Basic Arithmetic Operations** (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)  
‚úÖ **Looping Mechanism** (Continuous calculations until user exits)  
‚úÖ **Input Validation** (Handles invalid input and division by zero)  
‚úÖ **Session Summary** (Displays total operations performed upon exit)  
‚úÖ **Exit Condition** (`-666` to quit the program)

## **üìú How the Code Works**
1. The program prompts the user to enter **two integers**.  
2. If the user enters `-666` for either integer, the program **exits** and displays a summary.  
3. The user selects an **operation**:  
   - `1` ‚Üí Addition  
   - `2` ‚Üí Subtraction  
   - `3` ‚Üí Multiplication  
   - `4` ‚Üí Division  
4. The program checks the input and performs the selected operation.  
5. If division by zero is attempted, the program **displays an error** and **asks for new inputs**.  
6. The **operation count** is incremented for each valid operation.  
7. The program **loops** back to allow another calculation.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Compilation & Execution**
To compile and run the assembly calculator, use the following commands in your **Linux terminal**:

```bash
# Assemble the .asm file into an object file
nasm -f elf32 calculatorfinal.asm -o calculator.o

# Link the object file and create an executable
gcc -m32 calculator.o -o calculator -nostartfiles 

# Run the calculator
./calculator
```

## **üìù Example Usage**
```
Enter integer 1: 10
Enter integer 2: 5
Choose operation - 1:Add, 2:Subtract, 3:Multiply, 4:Divide, -666:Exit: 1
Result: 15

Enter integer 1: 8
Enter integer 2: 2
Choose operation - 1:Add, 2:Subtract, 3:Multiply, 4:Divide, -666:Exit: 4
Result: 4

Enter integer 1: 7
Enter integer 2: 0
Choose operation - 1:Add, 2:Subtract, 3:Multiply, 4:Divide, -666:Exit: 4
Division by zero error. Please try again.

Enter integer 1: -666
Total operations performed: 2
```

## **üí° Key Assembly Concepts Used**
This project demonstrates key **assembly language** concepts, including:
- **System Calls** (`scanf`, `printf`)
- **Registers Usage** (`eax`, `ebx`, `esp`)
- **Conditional Branching** (`cmp`, `je`, `jmp`)
- **Looping Constructs** (`jmp input_loop`)
- **Arithmetic Operations** (`add`, `sub`, `imul`, `div`)
- **Error Handling** (Division by Zero Prevention)
- **Exit Mechanism** (`int 0x80` for program termination)
